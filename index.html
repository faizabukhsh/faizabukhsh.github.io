I have also co-founded a company name Element199 in Pakistan. I received my PhD degree from Tilburg University, where I worked with Information systems research group. My PhD work was mainly focus on development of efficient and self-adaptive auditing solution. My work was mainly focused on utilizing ontological norms and <b>process mining</b> algorithms for <b>compliance checking</b> purpose. University of Twente has been my base since 2008, where I finished my Masters of Information system engineering in 2010 and then rejoin as a Post-Doc/Lecturer in 2015. I have been involved in a variety of research projects from information management domain namely LINC and Extended Single Window.  My research revolves around telecom <b>incident data analysis</b>, prediction and formulation of adaptive framework for predicting future incidents (during Post-doc), <b>information auditing</b> from services prospective (during PhD), information monitoring, compliance checking and identifying and reducing gap between “AS-IS” and “TO-BE” state of the business.
